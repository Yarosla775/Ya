# Introduction
 ModAPI is an application programming interface designed for the My Summer Car Modding Community. It allows the developer
 to easily implement a car part that can be attached to the satsuma (or anything really) with little effort. It also allows 
 easy access to common modding items, i.e common playmaker variables. 

# Getting Started

A walk-through of how to create your own truck engine install, see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI/wiki/Getting-started-in-v0.1.1.4-alpha>"
