# Introduction
 ModAPI is an application programming interface designed for the My Summer Car Modding Community. It allows the developer
 to easily implement a car part that can be attached to the satsuma (or anything really) with little effort. It also allows 
 easy access to common modding items, i.e common playmaker variables.

# Getting Started

- See Turbo mod to have a mad look at how to implement the new mod api v0.1.4.* structure. its a lot easier and straight forward. here's the link: see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/TurboMod"

- see secure spare tire mod to see how modapi (v0.1.4.2) is implemented in this mod! see "https://github.com/tommojphillips/SecureSpareTire"

- Secure Car jack is a mod that uses <i>mod api v0.1.4.2</i> gives a good representation on how to change/add logic to the assemble/disasemmble logic. I wanted Secure Car Jack to not allow the player to install/secure the jack unless it is folded. so i had to add logic to display an interaction tip to let the player know. See "https://github.com/tommojphillips/SecureCarJack"

#### [Obsolete] everything below is outdated infomation and won't exactly work from v0.1.4.1-alpha and on-wards.

- To see this API in action, take a look at the demo i have created with a truck engine that attaches to the roof of satsuma, see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/AttachObjectDemo>". - A walk-through of how to create your own truck engine install in version v0.1.1.4, see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI/wiki/Getting-started-in-v0.1.1.4-alpha>".  

- Cruise Control Panel for stock steering wheel created by Nitro and myself. see "https://github.com/tommojphillips/SatsumaCruiseControl"
