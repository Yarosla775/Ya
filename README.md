# Introduction
 ModAPI is an application programming interface designed for the My Summer Car Modding Community. It allows the developer
 to easily implement a car part that can be attached to the satsuma (or anything really) with little effort. It also allows 
 easy access to common modding items, i.e common playmaker variables.

# Getting Started
- To see this API in action, take a look at the demo i have created with a truck engine that attaches to the roof of satsuma, see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/AttachObjectDemo>".  
- A walk-through of how to create your own truck engine install in version 0.1.1.4, see "<https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI/wiki/Getting-started-in-v0.1.1.4-alpha>".  
- Cruise Control Panel for stock steering wheel created by Nitro and myself. see "https://github.com/tommojphillips/SatsumaCruiseControl"
- Secure Car jack is a mod that uses <i>mod api v0.1.2.0-alpha</i>, is secures the car jack to the left side of the Satsuma's trunk. See, "https://github.com/tommojphillips/SecureCarJack"  
Secure car jack v0.1 gives a good representation on how to change/add logic to the assemble/disasemmble logic. I wanted Secure Car Jack to not allow the player to install/secure the jack unless it is folded. so i had to add logic to display an interaction tip to let the player know.
