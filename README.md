# Introduction
 ModAPI is an application programming interface designed for the My Summer Car Modding Community. It allows the developer
 to easily implement a car part that can be attached to the satsuma (or anything really) with little effort. It also allows 
 easy access to common modding items, i.e common playmaker variables. 

# Getting Started
To see this API in action, take a look at the demo i have created. <https://github.com/tommojphillips/AttachObjectDemo>
